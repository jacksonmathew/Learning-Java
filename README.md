# Learning-Java

I am Learning Java from the basics from Kunal Kushwaha course, these are some of the basic code I wrote after taking the classes.

P.S: I know these are very basic codes (High School level) but I have always used Python to code and moving to Java is daunting so to have a familiarity I am writing and publishing the code.

Keep me in your Prayers🙏
